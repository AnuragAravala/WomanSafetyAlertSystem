# Woman Safety Alert System
A safety device which automatically alerts the parents of a woman with her location sent as SMS If she is in danger. Recently I have seen a lot of unfortunate incidents happening in my city which served as motivation for my project. I have developed this prototype in order to help the female employees returning from office in the night or via bad neighborhoods to save them from any unfortunate incidents.
It is a prototype developed using Arduino Uno. Two fingers of the woman are enrolled in the device, one for the safety system and the other one as on/off trigger for the device. Once she turns on the device, It asks for her finger every 1 minute. The Woman has to give her first finger indicating that she is ok and active. If she fails to authenticate her finger for 2 minutes, an SMS alert with her GPS coordinates will be sent to her parents stating that she is in danger. SIM900 GSM module and Neo6m GPS module were used for this purpose. She can also turn off the device voluntarily by placing her second finger which is enrolled as on/off trigger instead of the first finger. This is to ensure that no other person will be able to turn off the device without her consent
